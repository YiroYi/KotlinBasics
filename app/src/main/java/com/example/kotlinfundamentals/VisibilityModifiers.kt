package com.example.kotlinfundamentals

// public, this keyword can be ommited so every class, variable, method without public will be
// infered automatically as public

//private, allow the element to be accessible only within the block in which properties, fields
// are declared
// A private package can be accessible within a specific file
// private val x = 1
// private func myFunction()

//internal makes the field visible only inside the module in which it is implemented

//open in Kotlin all the classes are FINAL by default, so they can't be inherited by default
// in order that a class want to be inheritable you should use open
